                        <p class="bapu1">Mahatma Gandhi was the greatest leader of his times and the millions of people
                            used to respect and follow him. He completely changed his attire and wore a simple
                            loincloth, which, he thought, would let him connect to Indian poor. He took an active part
                            in the Indian Independence Movement and led India to the path of Independence through truth
                            and righteousness.</p>

                        <p class="SV1">Swami Vivekananda was a Hindu monk and direct disciple of Sri Ramakrishna.
                            Vivekananda played a key role in the introduction of Indian yoga and Vedanta philosophy in
                            the West. He made a strong impression at the inaugural World Parliament of Religions in
                            Chicago, 1893 giving a powerful speech on the underlying unity of world religions. He
                            taught a philosophy of traditional meditation and also selfless service (karma yoga). He
                            advocated emancipation for Indian women and an end to the worst excess of the caste system.
                            He is considered an important figurehead of Indiaâ€™s growing self-confidence and later
                            nationalist leaders often said they were inspired by his teachings and personality.</p>
